## Completed: Deterministic SSM (feature/wm-ssm)

Adopted **z-space closed-loop rollout** to address rollout error accumulation in the fixed-Δt AR architecture.

```
s_0 →enc→ z_0 →f→ z_1 →f→ z_2 → ... →f→ z_T   (z space only)
               ↓g     ↓g              ↓g
               ŝ_1    ŝ_2             ŝ_T
```

**v16 no-curriculum final results** (epoch 450, err=30.5cm):
- state err: 30.5cm (1.0s: 29.5cm / 2.0s: 36.1cm / 3.0s: 41.3cm)
- collision recall/prec: 0.549 / 0.540, type_acc: 0.905
- pocket recall: 0.000

**v17 focal fine-tune final results** (epoch 200, err=30.7cm):
- pocket class_weight=20 + focal_gamma=2.0
- pocket step recall: 0.000 → 0.109
- pocket episode recall: 0.000 → 0.250 (TP=16, FP=34, FN=48)
- Roadmap target (recall≥0.5, prec≥0.4) not met — step-by-step error accumulation is the fundamental bottleneck

**v18 pure latent final results** (epoch 400, err=31.6cm):
- ar_state feedback fully removed → z encodes all physics information on its own
- transition random init (v17 encoder/decoder retained)
- err=31.6cm, collision recall=0.549, episode pocket recall=0.312

**v18 scratch (random init) final results** (epoch 400, err=32.7cm):
- Same hyperparams as v18, no pretrained weights
- err=32.7cm, collision recall=0.512
- Pretraining benefit: ~1cm err / ~0.037 recall — marginal; GNN can train from scratch

## Next: WM → RL Integration

### Design Rationale

The fundamental problem with SAC critic Q(s,a): with only binary sparse reward (+1 pocket), it is difficult to learn "whether this action will pocket the ball."
Since WM predicts ball trajectories + collision types over 60-step rollouts, this can be leveraged as Q-target supervision.

### Prerequisites (blockers)

Two fundamental issues to resolve before attaching WM to RL:

#### Blocker 1: WM only supports 2-ball (current state=14-dim)

```
Current WM:  state = [cue(7) | tgt(7)]         = 14-dim  (2-ball)
RL problem:  state = [cue(7) | ball1(7) | ball2(7)] = 21-dim  (3-ball, n_balls=3)
```

- Current WM cannot model ball-ball interactions (target1 → target2 deflection)
- Must accept full ball layout as input to use as Q-target
- **Architecture change + data regeneration required**

**Direction**: GNN-based multi-agent architecture (n_balls dynamic)

#### Next Architecture: GNN World Model

Key design decisions derived from v16–v18 experiments and architectural analysis:

**1. Set-based / multi-agent (replaces fixed-dim concatenation)**

Each ball is a node with shared-weight encoder/decoder. n_balls becomes a runtime parameter.

```
Current SSM:  state = [cue(7) | tgt(7)] = 14-dim  (hardcoded 2-ball)
GNN:          state = N × ball(7),  N = any number of balls

node:  z_i = BallEncoder(ball_i_state, pocket_dists, is_cue)  [shared weights]
edge:  m_ji = BallBallMsg(z_i, z_j, Δpos, Δvel, dist)         [shared weights]
       m_pi = BallPocketMsg(z_i, Δpos_to_pocket, dist)         [shared weights]
update: z_i' = LN(z_i + MLP(cat(z_i, Σ_j m_ji, Σ_p m_pi)))
```

Message passing runs at every rollout step — necessary for multi-collision chains (ball1 → ball2 → ball3).

**Status**: `world_model/gnn/gnn_model.py` implemented and shape-verified (2-ball).
- Same weights handle N=2 and N=3 (tested).
- Parameters: 373,708 (vs v18: 253,331).

**2. No GRU / history tracking**
- Evidence: v17 (ar_state RNN) vs v18 (no ar_state) — minimal performance difference
- Billiards is Markovian: current state [pos + vel + spin] fully determines future
- Message passing handles inter-ball dependencies; no temporal memory needed

**3. Mixture transition — NLL loss (replaces MSE + RSSM-lite)**

Billiards physics is deterministic but chaotic (positive Lyapunov exponent). At bifurcation points (e.g., grazing collision — ball deflects left vs. right depending on sub-mm difference in contact point), a unimodal predictor (MSE or single Gaussian) averages over both modes and outputs a physically impossible middle trajectory.

**Why not single Gaussian RSSM**: `z_{t+1} ~ N(μ(z_t), σ(z_t))` has closed-form KL but collapses to mode-averaging. Gaussian-Gaussian KL is correct math, wrong problem.

**Design (MDN, no KL, no posterior)**:

Notation: $z_t = \mathrm{Enc}_\phi(s_t)$, $\phi'$ = EMA copy of $\phi$ (no gradient), $H$ = rollout length.

```
# MDN transition head — per ball, per step:
(π, μ, σ) = MixtureHead_θ(z_h)     # π:(B,N,K)  μ:(B,N,K,7)  σ:(B,N,K,7)  K=5
σ_k = softplus(σ_raw_k) + ε

# NLL target: EMA-encoded GT next state (stable anchor in z-space)
z̄_{h+1} = sg( Enc_φ'(s_{t+h+1}) )

L_NLL^h = -log Σ_k π_k · N(z̄_{h+1} ; μ_k, diag(σ_k²))

# Sampled next latent for rollout (stop-grad — cuts gradient through sampling):
k ~ Cat(π),  ẑ_{h+1} = sg( μ_k + σ_k ⊙ ε ),  ε ~ N(0, I)

L_NLL = Σ_{h=0}^{H-1} L_NLL^h
```

**Reconstruction** (encoder/decoder grounding — prevents z-space collapse):
```
L_recon = Σ_{h=0}^{H} || Dec_ψ(ẑ_h) - s_{t+h} ||²
```

**Total loss**:
```
L_total = L_NLL + λ · L_recon + L_type
```

Why z-space NLL target (not s-space directly): the EMA encoder $\phi'$ provides a stable target that does not shift with every gradient step of $\phi$. Using raw $s_{t+1}$ would require decoding each mixture component — more expensive and loses the latent structure.

Why reconstruction prevents collapse: encoder and transition cannot "conspire" to lower NLL while abandoning physical meaning — $L_{\text{recon}}$ forces $\text{Dec}_\psi(\hat{z}_h) \approx s_{t+h}$ at every rollout step, keeping z grounded.

**4. BYOL — deferred**

BYOL was considered to force the transition to encode future dynamics. However:
- $L_{\text{recon}}$ already prevents representational collapse
- The natural BYOL summary $\tilde{z}_h = \sum_k \pi_k \mu_k$ (mixture mean) reintroduces mode-averaging — the exact problem MDN was designed to solve
- The residual role ("prevent encoder-transition conspiracy") is already covered by the reconstruction constraint

**Decision**: omit BYOL from the baseline. Add only if reconstruction + NLL proves insufficient after empirical validation.

**5. Label smoothing**
```python
F.cross_entropy(logits, targets, label_smoothing=0.1)
```
Implemented in `ssm_model.py` and `gnn_model.py` via `--label-smoothing` arg.

#### Blocker 2: pocket recall improvement (resolved — accept current level)

v17 (focal+w=20): episode recall 0.250, prec=0.320. Target (≥0.5) not met.
v18 (no ar_state, epoch 180): episode recall 0.234. No meaningful improvement over v17.

**Decision: move forward with current recall (~0.25) rather than continuing to chase the target.**

Rationale:
- The fundamental bottleneck is chaos-induced error accumulation in step-by-step prediction, not the ar_state or training objective
- `pocket_prob = max(type_logit[..., 4])` still provides a useful (if noisy) signal for Q-target augmentation
- Architectural improvements (stochastic z, BYOL auxiliary loss) are better addressed in the 3-ball rewrite than incrementally

**Key finding from v17 vs v18 comparison**:
- ar_state removal had minimal impact on performance (err: 30.7 → 32.6cm; recall: 0.549 → 0.517)
- The v16→v17 improvement came from focal loss + class weights, not from ar_state
- History tracking (GRU/ar_state) is not necessary for this Markovian physics problem

### Plan (in priority order)

| Step | Content | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| **① pocket prediction fix** | v17 focal+weight=20 → recall 0.250; v18 no-ar → 0.234 | [x] Done (accepted as-is) |
| **① v18 pure latent** | Remove ar_state → self-contained z representation | [~] In progress (ep.252/400) |
| **② WM multi-ball extension** | 3-ball Stochastic SSM + BYOL + label smoothing | [ ] Pending |
| **③ Q-target augmentation** | WM(s_1, T=60) → pocket probability → Q-target label | [ ] Pending |
| ④ Auxiliary loss | critic loss + WM pocket prediction parallel training | [ ] Pending |
| ⑤ Reward shaping | WM dense reward → SAC | [ ] Pending |

### ③ Q-target Augmentation (WM-augmented critic)

```python
s_hat, type_logit = wm(s_1, n_steps=60)         # s_1: actual state after env step
pocket_prob = type_logit[0, :, 4].max().item()   # max pocket probability within 60 steps
q_target = r + gamma * V(s') + lambda * pocket_prob
```

Difference from Dyna: WM provides Q-labels directly rather than generating (s,a,r,s') → **WM-augmented critic**

## Next: Exp-17 · Phase 0 HRL

### Design Rationale

Problem with Phase 0 flat policy: since the delta_angle reference is the nearest ball direction, **which pocket to aim for is only determined implicitly.**
A nearest pocket bias can emerge during training via curriculum and similar processes.

```
System 2 (newly trained): pocket selection (discrete 6)
                       ↓
obs rearrangement: target_pocket_xy → injected at front of obs
                       ↓
System 1 (pocket-conditioned, after freeze):
  learns "the angle needed to sink the ball into this pocket"
```

**Credit assignment solution:**
- Train System 1 sufficiently first, then freeze
- During subsequent System 2 training, failure is attributed to System 2's pocket selection
- System 2 converges statistically (over thousands of episodes)

**Implementation:** DQN (System 2, discrete 6) + SAC (System 1, continuous) + custom env wrapper

### Obs Design

**Current Phase 0 obs (16-dim):**
```
[cue_x, cue_y,        # 2
 ball_x, ball_y,      # 2
 p0_x, p0_y,          # 12 (6 pockets, fixed order)
 p1_x, p1_y,
 ...
 p5_x, p5_y]
```

**System 1 obs (16-dim, same size):**
```
[cue_x, cue_y,              # 2
 ball_x, ball_y,            # 2
 target_x, target_y,        # 2  ← always obs[4:6] = selected pocket
 other_p0_x, other_p0_y,    # 10 (remaining 5 pockets)
 ...
 other_p4_x, other_p4_y]
```

When System 2 selects a pocket idx, that pocket is placed at obs[4:6] and the remaining 5 are filled in after.
→ obs size preserved (16-dim), System 1 always trains with "obs[4:6] is the target pocket."

**System 1 training reward change:**
```
Current: +1 (when ball enters any pocket)
Changed: +1 (only when ball enters the target pocket)
```

**Feasible pocket selection (resolving random target pocket issue):**
```
cut_angle(pocket_i) = arccos(dot(normalize(B-C), normalize(P_i - B)))
feasible = [i for i in range(6) if cut_angle(i) < 60°]
target_pocket = random.choice(feasible)  # fallback: argmin(cut_angle) if empty
```

## Next: Exp-17 · Phase 1 HRL

### Design Rationale

The bottleneck of the current flat MLP is mixing two levels of problems:

| | System 1 (aiming) | System 2 (strategy) |
|---|---|---|
| **Role** | Does shooting at this angle+speed sink that ball? | Which ball first, into which pocket |
| **Reward** | Immediate (+1 per pocket) | Sparse and delayed (9% clear) |
| **Current problem** | Hardcoded to nearest-ball greedy | Almost no gradient signal |

```
System 2 (newly trained):  target ball selection (discrete 3)
                       ↓
obs rearrangement:  [cue_xy, target_xyz, other1_xyz, other2_xyz, 6pockets]
             target ball → moved to ball[0] position
                       ↓
System 1 (Phase 1 Exp-10 freeze):
  delta_angle = 0 → aims toward ball[0] direction (= target)
```

### Exp-17 variants

| | 17a | 17b | 17c |
|---|-----|-----|-----|
| **System 2 action** | ball selection (discrete 3) | ball+pocket (discrete 18) | ball+pocket (discrete 18) |
| **System 1** | Phase 1 freeze | Phase 1 freeze | joint training |
| **OOD risk** | low | medium | none |
| **Key question** | Is the HRL structure itself valid? | Does pocket info help? | Possible without pretraining? |

**Experiment order:** 17a → 17b → 17c
